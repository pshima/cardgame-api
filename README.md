- **Small**: 64x90 pixels - Good for hand displays and medium UI elements  
- **Large**: 200x280 pixels - Full-size card display

### Image URLs in Responses

Every card object in API responses includes an `images` object with URLs:

```json
{
  "rank": 1,
  "suit": 0,
  "face_up": true,
  "images": {
    "icon": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/icon/1_0.png",
    "small": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/small/1_0.png",
    "large": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/large/1_0.png"
  }
}
```

Face-down cards return the card back image:
```json
{
  "rank": 13,
  "suit": 2,
  "face_up": false,
  "images": {
    "icon": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/icon/back.png",
    "small": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/small/back.png",
    "large": "http://localhost:8080/static/cards/large/back.png"
  }
}
```

### Generating Card Images

Card images are pre-generated using the included generator:
```bash
go run generate_cards.go
```

This creates all 52 cards plus card backs in all three sizes (157 total images).

    "hand_size": 2,
    "hand_value": 16,
    "has_blackjack": false,
    "is_busted": false
  }
}
```

### Step 6: Player Actions

#### Alice has blackjack, so Bob plays first
```bash
# Bob hits (takes another card)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/hit/player-uuid-bob"
```

**Response:**
```json
{

  "player_id": "player-uuid-bob",
  "player_name": "Bob",
  "hand_value": 21,
  "hand_size": 3,
  "has_blackjack": false,
  "is_busted": false,
  "message": "Card dealt to Bob"
}
```

#### Bob got 21! Now he stands
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/123e4567-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174000/stand/player-uuid-bob"

      "score": 0
    },
    {
      "id": "player-uuid-bob", 
      "name": "Bob",
      "hand": [...],
      "hand_size": 6,
      "score": 0
    }
  ],
  "crib": [],
  "crib_size": 0,
  "play_total": 0,
  "player_scores": [0, 0],
  "game_score": 121
}
```

### Step 5: Discard Phase - Players Put 2 Cards in Crib
```bash
# Bob (non-dealer) discards first - put cards at indices 4 and 5 into crib
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/discard/player-uuid-bob" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_indices": [4, 5]}'

# Alice (dealer) discards next
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/discard/player-uuid-alice" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_indices": [3, 5]}'
```

**Response after both players discard:**
```json
{
  "game_id": "456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111",
  "player_id": "player-uuid-alice", 
  "player_name": "Alice",
  "phase": "play",
  "starter": {
    "rank": 6,
    "suit": 2,
    "face_up": true,
    "images": {...}
  },
  "message": "Cards discarded, starter cut, play phase begun"
}
```

### Step 6: Play Phase - Alternate Playing Cards (Pegging)
```bash
# Bob plays first card (non-dealer leads)
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/play/player-uuid-bob" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_index": 0}'

# Alice plays a card
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/play/player-uuid-alice" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_index": 1}'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "game_id": "456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111",
  "player_id": "player-uuid-alice",
  "player_name": "Alice",

  "play_count": 2,
  "player_score": 2,
  "phase": "play",
  "current_player": 1,
  "message": "Card played"
}
```

### Step 7: Continue Play Until Cards Exhausted
Players continue alternating plays. If a player can't play without exceeding 31, they say "go":

```bash
# Player says "go" when they can't play
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/go/player-uuid-bob"
```

### Step 8: Show Phase - Score Hands and Crib
```bash
# After all cards are played, score the hands
curl "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/show"
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "game_id": "456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111",
  "scores": {
    "player-uuid-bob": 8,
    "player-uuid-alice": 12,
    "crib": 6
  },
  "player_scores": [18, 8],
  "phase": "deal",
  "status": "in_progress"
}
```

### Step 9: Continue Until Game Ends at 121 Points
The game continues with new deals until one player reaches 121 points:

```json
{
  "game_id": "456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111",
  "scores": {...},
  "player_scores": [121, 95],
  "phase": "finished",
  "status": "finished",
  "winner": "Alice",
  "winner_id": "player-uuid-alice"
}
```

## Observability and Debugging

The Card Game API includes comprehensive observability features to monitor application performance and troubleshoot issues in production.

### Logging

The application uses structured JSON logging with configurable log levels:

#### Environment Variables
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) - defaults to INFO
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES`: Comma-separated list of trusted proxy IPs for correct client IP extraction

#### Log Levels and Usage
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operations (card dealing, game state changes, validation steps)
- **INFO**: Normal operations (requests, game creation, successful operations)
- **WARN**: Validation failures, invalid requests, recoverable errors
- **ERROR**: System errors, failed operations, server failures

#### Example Log Output
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "time": "2025-07-29T18:18:51-07:00",
  "caller": "cardgame-api/main.go:242",
  "message": "Request completed",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/game/abc123/deal",
  "query": "",
  "user_agent": "curl/8.7.1",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "game_id": "abc123",
  "status_code": 200,
  "latency": 0.000101375,
  "latency_human": "101.375¬µs"
}
```

### Metrics

OpenTelemetry metrics are collected for monitoring application performance:

#### Available Metrics
- `http_requests_total`: Counter of total HTTP requests by method, path, status code
- `http_request_duration_seconds`: Histogram of request latency in seconds
- `http_requests_in_flight`: Current number of HTTP requests being processed
- `active_games`: Current number of active games
- `active_custom_decks`: Current number of custom decks
- `cards_dealt_total`: Counter of total cards dealt
- `games_created_total`: Counter of total games created
- `api_errors_total`: Counter of API errors (5xx status codes)

#### Metrics Endpoints
- **Prometheus Format**: `GET /metrics` - Standard Prometheus metrics format
- **JSON Stats**: `GET /stats` - Human-readable JSON metrics summary

#### Example Stats Response
```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "cardgame-api",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "uptime": "2h34m15s"
  },
  "games": {
    "active_count": 15,
    "total_created": 247
  },
  "metrics": {
    "http_requests_total": 1523,
    "cards_dealt_total": 8934,
    "api_errors_total": 12
  },
  "system": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-29T20:52:15Z",
    "log_level": "info"
  }
}
```

### Debugging Common Issues

#### Game Not Found Errors
1. Check logs for game creation: `game_id` field in request logs
2. Verify game exists: `curl http://localhost:8080/games`
3. Check if game was deleted: Look for DELETE operations in logs

#### Card Dealing Issues
- **No cards remaining**: Check `remaining_cards` in game state
- **Invalid game state**: Verify game status is not "finished"
- **Player not found**: Confirm player was added to game

#### Performance Issues
1. Monitor `/metrics` endpoint for high latency
2. Check `http_requests_in_flight` for request queuing
3. Review `http_request_duration_seconds` histogram

#### Log Analysis
```bash
# Filter by game ID
cat app.log | jq 'select(.game_id == "your-game-id")'

# Monitor error rates
cat app.log | jq 'select(.level == "error")'

# Track API performance
cat app.log | jq 'select(.latency != null) | {path, latency_human, status_code}'

# Watch live logs
tail -f app.log | jq 'select(.level == "error" or .status_code >= 400)'
```

#### Environment Configuration for Production
```bash
# Set log level to reduce verbosity
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Configure trusted proxies for load balancers
export TRUSTED_PROXIES="10.0.1.100,192.168.1.0/24"

# Set Gin to release mode
export GIN_MODE=release
```

#### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up alerts on `api_errors_total` metric spikes
2. Monitor `http_request_duration_seconds` 95th percentile
3. Track `active_games` growth over time
4. Alert on sustained high `http_requests_in_flight`

### Common Log Patterns for Debugging

#### Successful Game Flow
```
INFO Request started: POST /game/new
DEBUG Creating new game: decks=1, type=standard
INFO Game created successfully: game_id=abc123
INFO Request completed: status_code=200
```

#### Card Dealing Sequence
```
INFO Request started: GET /game/abc123/deal
DEBUG Dealing card: game_id=abc123, remaining_cards=51
INFO Card dealt successfully: card="Ace of Hearts", remaining_cards=50
INFO Request completed: status_code=200
```

#### Error Scenarios
```
WARN Invalid game ID provided: game_id=invalid-id
WARN Game not found: game_id=nonexistent-game
ERROR Request failed: status_code=404
```

## Container Deployment

The Card Game API is fully containerized with Docker support for easy deployment and scaling.

### Docker Images

The application uses a multi-stage build process to create minimal, secure container images:
- **Build stage**: Uses Go 1.24.4 Alpine for compilation
- **Runtime stage**: Uses Alpine Linux with non-root user for security
- **Final image size**: ~15MB (excluding static assets)

### Building the Container

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t cardgame-api:latest .

# Build with custom tags
docker build -t cardgame-api:v1.0.0 -t cardgame-api:latest .
```

### Running with Docker

```bash
# Basic run
docker run -p 8080:8080 cardgame-api:latest

# Run with custom configuration
docker run -d \
  --name cardgame-api \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG \
  -e PORT=8080 \
  -e GIN_MODE=release \
  -e TRUSTED_PROXIES="10.0.0.0/8" \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  cardgame-api:latest

# View logs
docker logs -f cardgame-api

# Check health
docker inspect cardgame-api --format='{{.State.Health.Status}}'
```

### Docker Compose

The included `docker-compose.yml` provides a complete development environment:

```bash
# Start the application
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop the application
docker-compose down

# Start with monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
docker-compose --profile monitoring up -d
```

### Environment Variables

Configure the container using these environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PORT` | Server port | `8080` |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) | `INFO` |
| `GIN_MODE` | Gin framework mode (debug, release) | `release` |
| `TRUSTED_PROXIES` | Comma-separated trusted proxy IPs | `""` |

### Health Checks

The container includes built-in health checks:
- **Endpoint**: `/hello`
- **Interval**: 30 seconds
- **Timeout**: 3 seconds
- **Retries**: 3

### Container Best Practices

1. **Security**:
   - Runs as non-root user (UID 1000)
   - Minimal Alpine base image
   - No unnecessary packages

2. **Resource Limits** (via docker-compose):
   - CPU: 1 core limit, 0.5 core reservation
   - Memory: 512MB limit, 256MB reservation

3. **Logging**:
   - JSON structured logs to stdout/stderr
   - Log rotation configured in docker-compose
   - Compatible with log aggregation systems

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Prometheus metrics at `/metrics`
   - Optional Prometheus/Grafana stack
   - Built-in health endpoint

### Kubernetes Deployment

Example Kubernetes deployment:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cardgame-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cardgame-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: cardgame-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: cardgame-api
        image: cardgame-api:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
        env:
        - name: LOG_LEVEL
          value: "INFO"
        - name: GIN_MODE
          value: "release"
        livenessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /hello
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 10
        readinessProbe:
          httpGet:
            path: /hello
            port: 8080
          initialDelaySeconds: 5
          periodSeconds: 5
        resources:
          limits:
            cpu: "1"
            memory: "512Mi"
          requests:
            cpu: "500m"
            memory: "256Mi"
```

### Production Considerations

1. **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx/traefik for SSL termination
2. **Secrets**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
3. **Persistence**: Games are in-memory; add Redis for persistence if needed
4. **Scaling**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
5. **Monitoring**: Connect to your existing Prometheus/Grafana stack

## Container Security

The Card Game API implements comprehensive security measures for containerized deployments.

### Security Features

#### 1. Secure Docker Image
- **Multi-stage build**: Minimal attack surface
- **Non-root user**: Runs as UID 65532
- **No shell**: Reduced exploitation risk
- **Read-only filesystem**: Prevents runtime modifications
- **Security labels**: Enables automated scanning

#### 2. Security Scanning
Run comprehensive security scans:
```bash
# Run all security scans
make security-scan

# Build with security validation
make docker-build-secure

# Run with enhanced security
make compose-security
```

#### 3. Secrets Management
Generate and manage secrets securely:
```bash
# Generate secure secrets
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Run with secrets
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secrets.yml up
```

#### 4. Security Configurations

**docker-compose.security.yml** includes:
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped Linux capabilities
- No new privileges flag
- Seccomp and AppArmor profiles
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, PIDs)
- Network isolation
- Localhost-only port binding

### Security Best Practices

#### Image Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Rebuild images weekly for security patches
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use Trivy/Clair before deployment
3. **SBOM Generation**: Track all dependencies
4. **Minimal Base**: Alpine Linux with only essential packages

#### Runtime Security
1. **Network Policies**: Restrict egress/ingress traffic
2. **Resource Limits**: Prevent DoS attacks
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure service availability
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all API access

#### Secrets Management
1. **Never hardcode**: Use environment variables or files
2. **Rotate regularly**: Implement key rotation
3. **Encrypt at rest**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets
4. **Minimal exposure**: Mount secrets as read-only files

### Security Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Run `make security-scan` and fix all HIGH/CRITICAL issues
- [ ] Generate new secrets with `./scripts/generate-secrets.sh`
- [ ] Review Dockerfile with `hadolint Dockerfile`
- [ ] Enable read-only root filesystem
