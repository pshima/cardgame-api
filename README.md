### Game Flow
1. Players join game (up to configured maximum)
2. Game starts - deals 2 cards to each player and dealer
3. Players' cards are face up, dealer's first card is face down
4. Players take turns hitting or standing
5. When all players finish, dealer plays automatically
6. Dealer hits on 16 or less, stands on 17 or more
7. Winners determined by comparing final hand values

### Win Conditions
- **Blackjack**: 21 with exactly 2 cards (beats regular 21)
- **Win**: Higher value than dealer without busting
- **Push**: Same value as dealer (tie)
- **Bust**: Hand value over 21 (automatic loss)
- **Lose**: Lower value than dealer

## Cribbage Rules Implemented

### Game Overview
- **Players**: Exactly 2 players
- **Cards**: Each player starts with 6 cards, discards 2 to the crib
- **Goal**: First player to reach 121 points wins
- **Scoring**: Points earned during play (pegging) and hand evaluation (show)

### Game Phases
1. **Deal**: Each player receives 6 cards
2. **Discard**: Each player puts 2 cards in the crib (dealer's bonus hand)
3. **Play**: Players alternate playing cards, keeping running total â‰¤ 31
4. **Show**: Score hands and crib, check for winner

### Cribbage Scoring

#### During Play (Pegging)
- **Fifteen**: Playing a card that makes the total exactly 15 (2 points)
- **Thirty-One**: Playing a card that makes the total exactly 31 (2 points)
- **Pairs**: Playing a card of the same rank as the previous card (2 points)
- **Runs**: Playing cards that form a sequence with recent cards (1 point per card)
- **Go**: Last card played when opponent can't play (1 point)

#### During Show (Hand Scoring)
- **Fifteens**: Any combination of cards totaling 15 (2 points each)
- **Pairs**: Two or more cards of the same rank (2 points per pair)
- **Runs**: Three or more consecutive ranks (1 point per card)
- **Flush**: All hand cards same suit (4 points, 5 if starter matches)
- **Nobs**: Jack in hand matching starter suit (1 point)

### Card Values
- **Ace**: 1 point
- **2-10**: Face value
- **Face Cards (J, Q, K)**: 10 points each

### Crib Rules
- **Ownership**: Crib belongs to the dealer
- **Scoring**: Scored after both players' hands
- **Composition**: 4 cards (2 from each player) plus starter card
- **Dealer Alternation**: Dealer alternates each hand

### Special Rules
- **His Heels**: If starter card is a Jack, dealer gets 2 points immediately
- **Pegging Order**: Non-dealer plays first in each round
- **Go Rules**: When a player can't play without exceeding 31, they say "go"
- **Last Card**: Player who plays the last card of a round gets 1 point

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Design
The application follows clean architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ api/           - Request/response DTOs
â”œâ”€â”€ config/        - Configuration and observability setup
â”œâ”€â”€ handlers/      - HTTP request handlers (organized by feature)
â”œâ”€â”€ managers/      - Business logic managers
â”œâ”€â”€ middleware/    - HTTP middleware (logging, metrics)
â”œâ”€â”€ models/        - Domain models and entities
â”œâ”€â”€ services/      - Business logic services
â””â”€â”€ validators/    - Input validation logic
```

### Core Components
- **Models**: Domain entities (`Card`, `Deck`, `Player`, `Game`, `CustomDeck`)
- **Services**: Business logic layer for game operations
- **Handlers**: HTTP request handling separated by feature
- **Managers**: Thread-safe state management
- **Middleware**: Cross-cutting concerns (logging, metrics, recovery)

### Dependency Injection
- Clean dependency management through `HandlerDependencies` struct
- Service interfaces for testability
- Separation of HTTP concerns from business logic

### Thread Safety
All game operations are protected by read-write mutexes to ensure safe concurrent access across multiple games and players.

## Game Examples

## Observability and Debugging

The Card Game API includes comprehensive observability features to monitor application performance and troubleshoot issues in production.

### Logging

The application uses Zap for high-performance structured JSON logging:

#### Environment Variables
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Set logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) - defaults to INFO
- `LOG_FORMAT`: Log format (json, console) - defaults to json for production
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES`: Comma-separated list of trusted proxy IPs for correct client IP extraction

#### Log Levels and Usage
- **DEBUG**: Detailed operations (card dealing, game state changes, validation steps)
- **INFO**: Normal operations (requests, game creation, successful operations)
- **WARN**: Validation failures, invalid requests, recoverable errors
- **ERROR**: System errors, failed operations, server failures

#### Structured Logging Benefits
- **Performance**: Zap's zero-allocation design for minimal overhead
- **Context**: Automatic request ID and correlation tracking
- **Searchability**: JSON format for easy parsing and analysis
- **Integration**: Compatible with ELK, Splunk, Datadog, etc.

#### Example Log Output
```json
{
  "level": "info",
  "ts": 1722389931.234567,
  "caller": "middleware/logging.go:45",
  "msg": "HTTP request",
  "request_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "method": "GET",
  "path": "/game/abc123/deal",
  "client_ip": "192.168.1.100",
  "game_id": "abc123",
  "status": 200,
  "latency_ms": 0.101,
  "user_agent": "curl/8.7.1"
}
```

### Metrics

The application uses OpenTelemetry for comprehensive metrics collection with Prometheus export:

#### Metric Categories

**HTTP Metrics**
- `http_requests_total`: Total requests by method, path, status
- `http_request_duration_seconds`: Request latency histogram
- `http_requests_in_flight`: Current concurrent requests
- `http_request_size_bytes`: Request body size distribution
- `http_response_size_bytes`: Response body size distribution

**Business Metrics**
- `games_active`: Current number of active games by type
- `games_created_total`: Total games created by type
- `games_completed_total`: Games finished by type and result
- `players_active`: Current number of active players
- `cards_dealt_total`: Total cards dealt by game type
- `custom_decks_active`: Current number of custom decks
- `custom_cards_created_total`: Total custom cards created

**System Metrics**
- `go_*`: Go runtime metrics (goroutines, memory, GC)
- `process_*`: Process metrics (CPU, memory, file descriptors)
- `cardgame_build_info`: Build version and commit information

#### Metrics Endpoints
- **Prometheus Format**: `GET /metrics` - Standard Prometheus exposition format
- **JSON Stats**: `GET /stats` - Human-readable metrics summary
- **Version Info**: `GET /version` - Detailed build information

#### Example Stats Response
```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "cardgame-api",
    "version": "1.0.0",
    "uptime": "2h34m15s"
  },
  "games": {
    "active_count": 15,
    "total_created": 247
  },
  "metrics": {
    "http_requests_total": 1523,
    "cards_dealt_total": 8934,
    "api_errors_total": 12
  },
  "system": {
    "timestamp": "2025-07-29T20:52:15Z",
    "log_level": "info"
  }
}
```

### Debugging Common Issues

#### Game Not Found Errors
1. Check logs for game creation: `game_id` field in request logs
2. Verify game exists: `curl http://localhost:8080/games`
3. Check if game was deleted: Look for DELETE operations in logs

#### Card Dealing Issues
- **No cards remaining**: Check `remaining_cards` in game state
- **Invalid game state**: Verify game status is not "finished"
- **Player not found**: Confirm player was added to game

#### Performance Issues
1. Monitor `/metrics` endpoint for high latency
2. Check `http_requests_in_flight` for request queuing
3. Review `http_request_duration_seconds` histogram

#### Log Analysis
```bash
# Filter by game ID
cat app.log | jq 'select(.game_id == "your-game-id")'

# Monitor error rates
cat app.log | jq 'select(.level == "error")'

# Track API performance
cat app.log | jq 'select(.latency != null) | {path, latency_human, status_code}'

# Watch live logs
tail -f app.log | jq 'select(.level == "error" or .status_code >= 400)'
```

#### Environment Configuration

**Development**
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
export LOG_FORMAT=console
export GIN_MODE=debug
export METRICS_ENABLED=true
```

**Production**
```bash
export LOG_LEVEL=INFO
export LOG_FORMAT=json
export GIN_MODE=release
export TRUSTED_PROXIES="10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12"
export METRICS_ENABLED=true
export OTEL_SERVICE_NAME=cardgame-api
export OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES="environment=production,region=us-east-1"
```

#### Monitoring Recommendations
1. Set up alerts on `api_errors_total` metric spikes
2. Monitor `http_request_duration_seconds` 95th percentile
3. Track `active_games` growth over time
4. Alert on sustained high `http_requests_in_flight`

### Common Log Patterns for Debugging

#### Successful Game Flow
```
INFO Request started: POST /game/new
DEBUG Creating new game: decks=1, type=standard
INFO Game created successfully: game_id=abc123
INFO Request completed: status_code=200
```

#### Card Dealing Sequence
```
INFO Request started: GET /game/abc123/deal
DEBUG Dealing card: game_id=abc123, remaining_cards=51
INFO Card dealt successfully: card="Ace of Hearts", remaining_cards=50
INFO Request completed: status_code=200
```

#### Error Scenarios
```
WARN Invalid game ID provided: game_id=invalid-id
WARN Game not found: game_id=nonexistent-game
ERROR Request failed: status_code=404
```

## Container Deployment

The Card Game API is fully containerized with production-grade Docker support.

### Docker Images

**Multi-Stage Build Process**
1. **Dependencies Stage**: Caches Go modules for faster rebuilds
2. **Build Stage**: Compiles with optimizations and version injection
3. **Runtime Stage**: Minimal Alpine image with security hardening

**Image Characteristics**
- **Base**: Alpine Linux 3.19 (minimal attack surface)
- **Size**: ~15MB base + ~5MB static assets
- **User**: Non-root (UID 65532)
- **Security**: No shell, read-only filesystem capable

### Building the Container

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t cardgame-api:latest .

# Build with custom tags
docker build -t cardgame-api:v1.0.0 -t cardgame-api:latest .
```

### Production Considerations

1. **Reverse Proxy**: Use nginx/traefik for SSL termination
2. **Secrets**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets for sensitive data
3. **Persistence**: Games are in-memory; add Redis for persistence if needed
4. **Scaling**: Stateless design allows horizontal scaling
5. **Monitoring**: Connect to your existing Prometheus/Grafana stack

## Container Security

The Card Game API implements comprehensive security measures for containerized deployments.

### Security Features

#### 1. Secure Docker Image
- **Multi-stage build**: Minimal attack surface
- **Non-root user**: Runs as UID 65532
- **No shell**: Reduced exploitation risk
- **Read-only filesystem**: Prevents runtime modifications
- **Security labels**: Enables automated scanning

#### 2. Security Scanning
Run comprehensive security scans:
```bash
# Run all security scans
make security-scan

# Build with security validation
make docker-build-secure

# Run with enhanced security
make compose-security
```

#### 3. Secrets Management
Generate and manage secrets securely:
```bash
# Generate secure secrets
./scripts/generate-secrets.sh

# Run with secrets
docker-compose -f docker-compose.secrets.yml up
```

#### 4. Security Configurations

**docker-compose.security.yml** includes:
- Read-only root filesystem
- Dropped Linux capabilities
- No new privileges flag
- Seccomp and AppArmor profiles
- Resource limits (CPU, memory, PIDs)
- Network isolation
- Localhost-only port binding

### Security Best Practices

#### Image Security
1. **Regular Updates**: Rebuild images weekly for security patches
2. **Vulnerability Scanning**: Use Trivy/Clair before deployment
3. **SBOM Generation**: Track all dependencies
4. **Minimal Base**: Alpine Linux with only essential packages

#### Runtime Security
1. **Network Policies**: Restrict egress/ingress traffic
2. **Resource Limits**: Prevent DoS attacks
3. **Health Checks**: Ensure service availability
4. **Audit Logging**: Track all API access

#### Secrets Management
1. **Never hardcode**: Use environment variables or files
2. **Rotate regularly**: Implement key rotation
3. **Encrypt at rest**: Use Docker secrets or Kubernetes secrets
4. **Minimal exposure**: Mount secrets as read-only files
