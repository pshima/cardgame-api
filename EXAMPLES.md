  -d '{"name": "My Fantasy Deck"}'
```

  "crib": [],
  "crib_size": 0,
  "play_total": 0,
  "player_scores": [0, 0],
  "game_score": 121
}
```

### Step 5: Discard Phase - Players Put 2 Cards in Crib
```bash
# Bob (non-dealer) discards first - put cards at indices 4 and 5 into crib
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/discard/player-uuid-bob" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_indices": [4, 5]}'

# Alice (dealer) discards next
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/discard/player-uuid-alice" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_indices": [3, 5]}'
```

**Response after both players discard:**

    "suit": 2,
    "face_up": true,
    "images": {...}

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"card_index": 0}'

# Alice plays a card
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/play/player-uuid-alice" \

```bash
# Player says "go" when they can't play
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/go/player-uuid-bob"
```

### Step 8: Show Phase - Score Hands and Crib
```bash
# After all cards are played, score the hands
curl "http://localhost:8080/game/456e7890-e89b-12d3-a456-426614174111/cribbage/show"
