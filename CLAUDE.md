# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview
This is a comprehensive Card Game API built with Go and the Gin web framework. The API provides full blackjack gameplay functionality, custom deck creation, card images, player management, security features, and complete OpenAPI documentation.

## Tech Stack
- **Language**: Go 1.24.4
- **Framework**: Gin (github.com/gin-gonic/gin)
- **Module**: github.com/peteshima/cardgame-api
- **UUID Generation**: Google UUID (github.com/google/uuid)
- **Image Generation**: Go's image package with custom rendering
- **Font Rendering**: golang.org/x/image/font with Go fonts
- **Testing**: Testify (github.com/stretchr/testify/assert)

## Key Features
- **Complete Blackjack Implementation**: Full game flow with automatic dealer play
- **Cribbage Support**: Full 2-player cribbage implementation with pegging and scoring
- **Multiple Deck Types**: Standard (52 cards) and Spanish 21 (48 cards, no 10s)
- **Custom Deck Creation**: Free-form custom decks with custom cards, suits, ranks, and attributes
- **Card Images**: Auto-generated PNG images in 3 sizes (icon: 32x48, small: 64x90, large: 200x280) for standard cards
- **Game Compatibility**: Custom cards with numeric ranks can be used in traditional games
- **Tombstone Deletion**: Custom cards are marked as deleted but remain queryable
- **Security**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **API Documentation**: Complete OpenAPI 3.0 specification with interactive Swagger UI
- **Concurrent Games**: Thread-safe operations supporting multiple simultaneous games
- **Player Management**: Add/remove players with UUID-based identification

## Development Notes

### Server Configuration
- Server runs on port 8080 by default
- All API responses are in JSON format
- Uses Gin's default middleware for logging and recovery
- Serves static files from `./static` directory
- CORS headers not configured (add if needed for web apps)
- Trusted proxy configuration for production security

### Environment Variables
- `TRUSTED_PROXIES` - Comma-separated list of trusted proxy IPs (e.g., "10.0.1.100,192.168.1.0/24")
- `GIN_MODE` - Set to "release" for production deployment

### Security Features
- All URI parameters validated with regex patterns
- Input sanitization removes control characters
- Length limits enforced on all string inputs
- UUID validation for game and player IDs
- Special handling for "dealer" player ID
- Numeric parameters have reasonable upper limits
- Custom deck validation: deck names (1-128 chars), cards (2000 max), attributes (100 max)

### Data Models
- **Ranks**: 1=Ace, 2-10=Number cards, 11=Jack, 12=Queen, 13=King
- **Suits**: 0=Hearts, 1=Diamonds, 2=Clubs, 3=Spades
- **Game Status**: waiting, in_progress, finished
- **Blackjack Results**: blackjack, win, push, bust, lose
- **Custom Cards**: Free-form with name, optional rank/suit, attributes, game_compatible flag, tombstone deletion

### Card Images
- All cards include `images` object with URLs in responses
- Face-down cards show card back image
- Images auto-generated with proper symbol counts for each rank
- Traditional playing card layouts and colors

### Blackjack Logic
- Ace values: 11 or 1 (automatically optimized)
- Face cards: 10 points each
- Blackjack: 21 with exactly 2 cards
- Dealer: hits on 16, stands on 17
- Automatic dealer play when all players finish

### Thread Safety
- GameManager uses read-write mutexes
- Safe for concurrent access across multiple games
- Each game has independent state

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for validation functions
- Integration tests for deck types
- Manual testing scripts for functionality
- Visual testing for card images

### Common Development Tasks
1. **Add new endpoint**: Update main.go routing, add handler function, update OpenAPI spec
2. **Modify game logic**: Update card.go structs and methods, add tests
3. **Add validation**: Update validation functions in main.go, add tests in validation_test.go
4. **Update documentation**: Modify README.md and openapi.yaml
5. **Add new card size**: Update generate_cards.go constants and functions
6. **Custom deck features**: Modify CustomCard/CustomDeck structs in card.go, update CustomDeckManager methods

## Best Practices
- Always update the openapi documentation whenever the api changes

## Code Guidelines
- If you add new functions or classes, make sure to add code comments, 1-3 lines describing what it does and why it is needed

## Security Considerations
- Make sure to take security considerations in for all updates

## Testing Guidelines
- When making any changes please make sure all tests pass and fix them if they do not.  Code coverage should be 80% or above
